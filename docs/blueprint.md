# **App Name**: EvoFriend

## Core Features:

- 3D Character Model: Load a .glb or .gltf 3D character model that looks cute and friendly.
- Idle Animations: Implement idle animations such as blinking, bobbing, and gentle breathing to make the character feel alive.
- Talking and Reactive Animations: Animate mouth movement synced to speech for a talking effect. Also implement eye tracking and subtle body movements to make the interaction realistic.
- Voice Interaction: Use Web Speech API for speech-to-text (user talking to bot) and Web Speech Synthesis API for text-to-speech (bot talking back). Add buttons to start/stop listening and to clear chat.
- AI Brain: Connect to OpenAI API for conversation logic. This tool should decide on when/if to incorporate information from the maintained chat history to provide conversation context and use emotional/keywords from the user input.
- Responsive UI: Maintain a minimal, dark-themed, and responsive layout with space for the 3D model, chat text area, and voice control buttons.
- Smooth Animations and Transitions: Transition smoothly between different states (idle, listening, talking). Use animated gradients or particle effects in the background to add a futuristic look.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm, inviting blue (#64B5F6) to evoke friendliness and intelligence.
- Background color: Dark gray (#263238), creating a sophisticated, modern look.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFAB40) to highlight interactive elements, adding warmth.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, to maintain a modern and neutral look. Its clean lines ensure readability and match the app's conversational focus.
- Use clean, minimalist icons. Aim for a consistent style that's easy to understand.
- Subtle animations and transitions. For example, when switching between states.
- Keep layout minimal and modern. A centered floating 3D model in the middle and a chat text area at the bottom.
